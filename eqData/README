This file contains a program which scrapes the ANSS FTP for every
earthquake between 1990 and 2016. Note that this dataset is about
1 GB in size (in text!)  and has to open a new socket for every 
month in that time frame.

If you want to run it:

    make
    ./scrape

It's in C because that's what I'm good at.  Barnaby would probably
make some comment here about bash.
